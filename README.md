# Science-Practical-WebApp
Repository for a secondary school science practicals python web application.

The python web app will allow students (predominantly in secondary or post-16 education in the UK) to enter all kinds of data about the core practicals they must take.

Web app will allow sutdents to follow exam-board specific methods on how to do practicals, allow students to enter their own data and then plot it for them.
Web app will also allow students to explain the trends in their graph based off their results. Moreover, students can enter their own personal notes on what they'v egained from carrying out the various practicals.

This web app will effectively function as an online practical lab book for secondary and post-16 students.

Title: Microscopy

Equipment:
•	a small piece of onion
•	Scalpel
•	White tile
•	forceps
•	Microscope slide
•	Coverslip
•	Microscope
•	Iodine solution


Method:
1.	Use a dropping pipette to put one drop of water onto a microscope slide.
3.	Peel off a thin layer of epidermal tissue from the inner surface of the onion.
4.	Use forceps to put this thin layer on to the drop of water that you have placed on the microscope slide.
5.	Make sure that the layer of onion cells is flat on the slide.
6.	Put two drops of iodine solution onto the onion tissue.
7.	Carefully lower a coverslip onto the slide.  Do this by:
  •	Placing one edge of the coverslip on the slide
  •	Using the forceps to lower the other edge onto the slide
  [Note: There may be some liquid around the edge of the coverslip - Use a piece of kitchen paper to soak this liquid up.]
9.  Put the slide on the microscope stage.
10.	Use the lowest power objective lens (turn the nosepiece to do this).
11.	The end of the objective lens needs to almost touch the slide - Do this by turning the coarse adjustment knob whilst looking at the microscope side-on (not through the eyepiece).
12.	Looking through the eyepiece, turn the coarse adjustment knob until the cells come into focus.
13.	Now rotate the nosepiece to a higher power objective lens.
14.	Slightly rotate the fine adjustment knob to bring the cells into a clear focus.

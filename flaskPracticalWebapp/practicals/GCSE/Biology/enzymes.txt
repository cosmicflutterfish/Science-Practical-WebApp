Title: Enzymes

Equipment:
•	Test tubes
•	Test tube rack
•	Water bath (or Bunsen burner and beakers)
•	Spotting tiles
•	5cm3 measuring cylinder
•	Syringes
•	Stopwatch
•	Starch solution
•	Amylase solution
•	Buffered pH solutions
•	Iodine solution


Method:
1.	Place one drop of iodine solution into each depression on the spotting tile.
2.	Place labelled test tubes containing buffered pH solutions, amylase solution and starch solutions in the water bath.
3.	Allow the solutions to reach 30 °C.
4.	Add 2cm3 of one of the buffered solutions to a test tube.
5.	Use the syringe to a 2 cm3 of amylase to the buffered pH solution.
6.	Use another syringe to add 2 cm3 of starch to the solution.
7.	Mix using a glass rod and immediately start the stopwatch (leave it on throughout the test).
9.	After 10 seconds, remove one drop of the mixture with a glass rod.
    Place this drop on the first depression of the spotting tile with the iodine solution.
	  The iodine solution should turn blue-black.
10.	Use the glass rod to remove one drop of the mixture every 10 seconds. Put each drop onto the iodine solution in the next depression on the spotting tile.
	  Rinse the glass rod with water after each drop.
	  Continue until the iodine solution and the amylase/ buffer/ starch mixture remain orange.
11.	Repeat the procedure with solutions of different pHs.
12.	Record your results in a table.
pH of solution	Time taken for amylase to completely break down the starch in seconds (s)

13.	Plot a graph with:
  •	‘pH of  solution’ on the x-axis
  •	‘Time taken to break down starch (s)’ on the y-axis
OR
	Calculate the rate of reaction and plot a graph with:
  •	‘pH of  solution’ on the x-axis
  •	‘Rate of reaction’ on the y-axis
